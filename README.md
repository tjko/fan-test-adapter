# fan-test-adapter
Adapter PCB board for easily testing PC (PWM) fans.

Adapter was created to simplify characterising PC fans. It's mainly meant for PWM fans, but can also be useful for 3-pin PC fans. Adapter also has common JST connectors for common 2-pin fans.

Adapter is meant to be used with
* 3 channel programmable power supply (but will work fine with 1 or 2 channel PSUs)
* 2+ channel oscilloscope
* 2 channel signal generator
